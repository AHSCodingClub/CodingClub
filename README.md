**Hacktoberfest is an annual coding event where you can win a free t-shirt, just for writing code!**

### Setting up GitHub and linking it to Hacktoberfest
First, you'll need to make a GitHub account. That's pretty simple, just go to [github.com/signup](github.com/signup). You can use your school email or personal email, but if you're going to keep on coding, you should probably use your personal (since GitHub is so big and you're definitely going to keep using it).


Once you have GitHub set up, link it to the Hacktoberfest event site.

1. Go to [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)


2. Click the <kbd>Start Hacking</kbd> button

### Making a pull request

Pull requests sound scary but they just mean "code contribution." That can be adding your own code, or modifying someone else's. For now, just add your own code (could be anything).


1. Go to the [CodingClub sample repository](https://github.com/aheze/CodingClub)
    - "Repository" = folder of code

2. Click <kbd>Fork</kbd>. This will make a copy of the folder that you can edit.

3. Add a file.

![Add file -> Create new file](Images/AddNewFile.png)

4. Paste in your code!

```
print("Hello world")
```

5. Commit your changes.
    - "Commit" = save your code

![Commit new file](Images/CommitChanges.png)

6. You have added your file. Time to create a pull request now

![Contribute -> Open pull request](Images/OpenPR.png)

7. Confirm that you want to create a PR

![Click "Create pull request"](Images/CreatePR.png)

8. Thanks for the PR! We will accept it later and it will count to your 4 PRs.
